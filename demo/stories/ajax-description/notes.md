The source data for the description can be loaded from a remote asset.

To do that, simply set `ajax:YOUR_URL` as a description, and Aether Accordion will automatically resolve the request and set the result as the description value. There's nothing more into it!

NOTE: All AJAX assets are loaded when the accordion is inited.
